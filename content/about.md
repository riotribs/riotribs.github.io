This site is dedicated to honoring the [memory](https://www.terryfamilyfuneralhome.com/obituary/Leonard-PatrickSr) of Lorenzo, the founder of Riot Ribs.

Riot Ribs provided free food to protesters in Portland, Oregon, during the summer of 2020. Lorenzo inspired many people with his generosity, kindness, and perseverance in the
face of police violence and harassment during the protests.
